- Human Activity Recognition (HAR) aims to classify daily human activities using smartphone sensor data.

- Smartphones contain accelerometers and gyroscopes that capture detailed motion signals.

- The main challenge is transforming noisy, high-dimensional sensor readings into meaningful features.

- These features help machine learning algorithms identify activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and climbing stairs.

- This project extracts both time-domain and frequency-domain features from the raw smartphone data.

- Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated on these features.

- The goal is to determine the most effective approach for accurate activity recognition.
